### Introduction
Welcome to the Llama Hindi Tokenizer! This tokenizer is a crucial component in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Hindi language. In this README, we will explain what a tokenizer is, how it works, and how it is used in building LLMs.

### What is a Tokenizer?
A tokenizer is a software component that breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords (smaller units of words). Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as it allows machines to understand and process human language.

### How does a Tokenizer work?
A tokenizer typically works by applying a set of rules to the input text. These rules can include:

* Word separation: breaking down text into individual words
* Character separation: breaking down text into individual characters
* Subword separation: breaking down words into smaller subwords
* The output of a tokenizer is a sequence of tokens, which can be used as input to various NLP models.

## What is a BPE Tokenizer?
BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) is a type of tokenizer that is particularly well-suited for languages with complex scripts, such as Hindi. BPE tokenizers work by iteratively replacing the most frequent pair of bytes in the input text with a new token.

### Here's how it works:

- Initialize an empty vocabulary
- Iterate through the input text, replacing the most frequent pair of bytes with a new token
- Add the new token to the vocabulary
- Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired level of tokenization is reached
- BPE tokenizers are different from normal tokenizers in that they do not require a pre-defined set of tokens. Instead, they learn the tokens from the input data itself.

## How did you build this Llama Hindi Tokenizer?
We built this Llama Hindi Tokenizer by combining the AI4Bharat corpus with the Llama 2 32k Tokenizer. The AI4Bharat corpus is a large dataset of Hindi text, which was used to train the BPE Tokenizer. The Llama 2 32k Tokenizer is a pre-trained tokenizer that was fine-tuned on the AI4Bharat corpus.

### The training process involved the following steps:

1) Preprocessing: The AI4Bharat corpus was preprocessed to remove special characters and punctuation.
2) Tokenization: The preprocessed text was tokenized using the BPE Tokenizer.
3) Training: The tokenized text was used to train the Llama 2 32k Tokenizer on a L4 GPU with 16GB of VRAM and 24GB of RAM.
4) Fine-tuning: The trained tokenizer was fine-tuned on the AI4Bharat corpus to adapt to the specific characteristics of the Hindi language.
## Tokenizer Architecture
The Llama Hindi Tokenizer is based on the following architecture:

* Input: Hindi text
* Tokenization: BPE Tokenizer
* Vocabulary: Learned from the AI4Bharat corpus
* Output: Sequence of tokens
### Use Cases
The Llama Hindi Tokenizer can be used in a variety of applications, including:

1) Language modeling: The tokenizer can be used to generate text in Hindi.
2) Text classification: The tokenizer can be used to classify text in Hindi.
3)Sentiment analysis: The tokenizer can be used to analyze the sentiment of text in Hindi.
#### Training
The training process for the Llama Hindi Tokenizer involved the following steps:

* Data preparation: The AI4Bharat corpus was preprocessed to remove special characters and punctuation.
* Tokenization: The preprocessed text was tokenized using the BPE Tokenizer.
* Training: The tokenized text was used to train the Llama 2 32k Tokenizer on a L4 GPU with 16GB of VRAM and 24GB of RAM.
* Fine-tuning: The trained tokenizer was fine-tuned on the AI4Bharat corpus to adapt to the specific characteristics of the Hindi language.
- The training process took approximately 3 hours to complete.
